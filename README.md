### Project Description: Basic Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project involves creating a simple yet functional calculator using fundamental web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator will feature an interactive interface with buttons for basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

**Key Features:**
- **Display Screen:** A section to show user input and the results of the calculations.
- **Buttons:** A grid layout containing number buttons (0-9), operation buttons (+, -, *, /), a clear button (C), and an equals button (=) to perform the calculations.
- **CSS Grid Layout:** The buttons will be arranged using CSS Grid, ensuring a clean and organized layout.
- **JavaScript Functionality:** JavaScript will be used to handle user input through event listeners. Basic control structures like if-else statements and loops will manage the calculator's logic, performing operations based on user interaction.

This project is ideal for beginners looking to enhance their understanding of HTML for structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for adding interactive elements. Upon completion, you will have a functional calculator that demonstrates your ability to integrate these technologies effectively.
